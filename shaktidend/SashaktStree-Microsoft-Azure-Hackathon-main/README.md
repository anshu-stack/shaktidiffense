# Introduction

Sashakt Stree means <b>“Strong Woman”.</b> Our mission is <b>to educate, inspire, and empower</b> rural women. Our goal is to reach out to women in ever-more creative ways through technology and to make them “Sashakt” in their own ways! 

Over the last several years, our India has experienced numerous horrifying incidents involving women of all ages, both on social media and in real life. Every week, a large number of complaints are made, with the majority of them remaining unaddressed. Furthermore, more than half of the women are afraid to speak up. Apart from all of this distress, women are afraid to discuss their own health. In most rural regions of India, discussing health concerns has always been and continues to be taboo. A substantial number of women are unaware of the resources available to them in areas of education and economic freedom.

In light of this, we created <b>a website to address all of the challenges that women face</b> and to give a platform for all women to learn about their rights and opportunities available for them.

We're also working on <b>an AI assistant bot using Microsoft Azure</b> that will be incorporated into our website and help women find information about helplines, health-related remedial treatments, and women's safety, education, economic freedom policies and protection rights all in one place.

# Vision

<h3>To Educate</h3>

<h4>Our mission is to Educate, Inspire, and Empower rural women.</h4>
 
Education allows a woman to acquire more control over her life and participate in decision-making processes, allowing her to contribute socially and economically to the well-being of her family and community.
Our mission is to educate girls and women so that they may improve their own life prospects by gaining more knowledge, skills, self-confidence, and skills.
 
 
<h3>To Inform</h3>

<h4>Sashakt Stree means "Strong Woman”.</h4>
 
Sashakt Stree promotes knowledge about development, care and protection of rural women and girls through cross-cutting policies and programmes, spreading awareness about their rights and facilitating access to learning, nutrition, institutional and legislative support for enabling them to grow and develop to their full potential.

<h3>To Inspire</h3>

<h4>Our goal is to reach out to women in ever-more creative ways through technology. </h4>
 
There is something these inspirational women all share in common: they are all warriors and continue to inspire us in our own modern lives. Throughout history, women have fought courageously and tirelessly to assert themselves as individuals and experts in their field. It’s why the following women deserve celebrating and why they are as relevant now as they ever were in the past and Sashakt stree supports the same.

<h3>To Empower</h3>

<h4>To make them Sashakt in their own ways!</h4>
 
Empowering women and girls and achieving gender equality are crucial to creating inclusive, open and prosperous societies. Sashakt Stree promotes access and opportunity for women and girls and builds the skills and confidence of women and girls to achieve their potential and have more influence over decisions that affect their lives.

# Our Objectives

We aim to reach each and every girl/woman of rural India to educate and empower them through emerging technologies. We have covered 6 major sectors for the overall development of women. These are Education, Health, Safety, Empowerment, Economic Freedom, and opportunities for Women in Tech. We have researched the various sectors and provided links to the external sites which look into this matter, and helpline numbers of Concerned authorities (NGOs, Crime cells, and Women's cells). Moreover, we will be working on individual web pages of this objective hyperlinked with the main site. 

# Tools & Technologies
For now, we have developed a static website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We will be working on the backend which will store the data of users navigating to the site by asking for registration through firebase.
We will make it a dynamic website. We will contact the users through email.
The Project is advanced by introducing new features, an AI-powered chat bot which will clear the initial doubts of the users. The backend of the site is developed by Php and Collection of the data through Mysql Database to take the particular queries of the user and assist them with the message or email. We will enhance this project further and make it dynamic for real life applications.

# Developed Features:

<h3>AI assistant bot using Microsoft Azure:</h3>

A chatbot is a flexible and convenient approach to acquire information. They give end-users a fully individualized experience because most of them prefer texting to any other kind of communication. Natural language processing (NLP) is used by AI chatbots to assist consumers in interacting with web services or apps via text, visuals, or audio. Furthermore, AI chatbots employ predictive intelligence and analytics to learn a user's preferences and then utilize that information to make suggestions and anticipate requirements.

We have worked on an AI assistant bot using Microsoft Azure that incorporats into our website and help women find information about helplines, health-related remedial treatments, and women's safety, education, economic freedom policies and protection rights all in one place.


<h3>Website translation into local languages</h3>

According to a report in 2018, There are 121 languages which are spoken by 10,000 or more people in India, which has a population of 121 crore. We live in a multilingual world, so we will be offering our website in multiple languages so as to make it more user-friendly and connect with new audiences. It will help us expand our reach and provide access and information to those women who can read/write in their local language only.

<h3>Login and signup features:</h3>

Login and Signup features on Sashakt Stree website will be a security mechanism that will be used to restrict unauthorized access to member-only areas and tools on the site. We have created a simple registration and login system using PHP and MySQL and integrating it in the website.

<h3>Contact Us:</h3>

We have already created the frontend for the Contact Us form with fields like Name, Email, Number, Subject and Message. We also worked on the backend part of it so that all queries can be sent to us, the administrators and thus we can help the women facing any issues regarding the website.
A server side script is used to collect the form data and do the processing like send emails, save to the database etc. This form has come up with a PHP script to handle the form submissions. PHP is a widely supported server side scripting platform. When the form is submitted, the javascript form submission event handler above collects the form data and sends it to the server side script.
